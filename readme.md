## Running the project
To run the project locally, you will need to copy the content of [`config.example.json`](./config.example.json) to a `config.json` file and fill the required infos.

Also make sure that you have an up to date NodeJs version installed, and that all the dependencies are installed (use `npm i`).

### Starting
To start the program, run `npm run start`. It will compile the scss and then launch the server.

### Stylesheets
To dynamically compile the scss stylesheets separately, you can use `npm run scss`.
